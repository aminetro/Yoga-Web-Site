			<a name="iyengar"><center><iframe width="500" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/smkP-P-PPfk" title="Health-Movement" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

			<a name="hatha"><center><iframe width="500" height="350" title="dynamic" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UJrdrDClnw4" title="Health-Movement" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
 
			<p>HATHA YOGA : Hatha yoga might be the most original type of physical yoga asana practice, that we know of.. Hatha meaning sun and moon,in Hatha yoga you work separately on each classic yoga pose, finding calm and balance as you work the physical body, preparing for meditation.</p>
			<a name="ashtanga"><center><iframe width="500" height="350" title="Health-Movement title="dynamic" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vqt7P0PKghk" title="Health-Movement" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

			<p>ASHTANGA YOGA : Astanga has been taught and described by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois or as he respectfully was called; Gurujii. The practice of Ashtanga yoga is physically demanding, working gradually through different sequences of Asanas of increasing complexity. It creates a strong physical body and the combination of the poses is believed to be detoxing and rejuvenating for body and mind. Working strongly on focus, concentration and balance, with the goal of obtaining a calm mind and relaxed body.</p>
			<a name="aerial"><center><iframe width="500" height="350" title="balance" title="dynamic" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bQ5nGz5IDJY" title="Health-Movement" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

			<p>AERIAL YOGA : Aerial is a young yoga type. Creative, New Yorker cool and energetic is describing this type of yoga well. The asanas are done in hammocks hanging from the ceiling and the body weight used to get deeper into classic poses. Unnata meaning upliftet in sanskrit gives a clear idea of what Aerial Yoga is, as it is uplifting for both the body and mind. In this type of Aerial Yoga we are dedicated to the original Hatha Yoga practice, using the hammock as a prop. However the hammock can also be useful building core strength and a better balance – and can obviously also provide support in some fun, challenging – and maybe new – yoga poses.  Aerial Yoga practice can also be deeply calming and nurturing.</p>

			<p>ANUSARA YOGA : Anusara is also a newer type of yoga, invented by the American John Friend in 1997. Anusara meaning to follow the divine or to dance with grace. Hatha yoga is the foundation, the form is creative and flows are used in an almost dancelike mode. It is challenging and fun, and builds stamina, strength and balance. It is super popular in the US as it is demanding on a physical level, but at the same time provides the practitioner with tales and wisdom from ancient traditions, especially from the hindu culture.</p>
			 <a name="yin"><center><iframe title="mental-mediation" title="physical" width="500" height="350" title="balance" title="dynamic" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mATizOgzbKA" title="Health-Movement" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

			<p>YIN YOGA : Yin Yoga is a slow paced practice, where the poses are held for longer periods of times in developed by Paul Grilley as a way to create more balance in hectic life styles of modern day. Yin targets the connective tissue, fascia and tendons and works on a deeper physical level. It is an amazing compliment to more dynamic and muscular practice of running, spinning, swimming and yang types of yoga practices. In general yoga works with the idea of opposites, and the yoga practice most of us know is the yang type, it is fast paced and works the muscle tissue and the cardio vascular system. Yin yoga works on cooling the system down, stretching into areas that are difficult to get access to, and thus creating space and freedom within the body and essentially the mind.</p>

			<p>FORREST FLOW YOGA : Forrest Yoga is a modern yoga style based on Hatha yoga. It was created by and named for Ana T. Forrest, an American yogini. It is known for its long holding of positions, emphasis on abdominal core work, and standing series that can go on for 20 poses on each side.Reputed for its intensity, the style emphasizes connecting to one’s feelings in order to work through physical and emotional trauma.</p>
			<a name="sivananda"><center><iframe  title="flexibility" title="physical" width="500" height="350" title="balance" title="dynamic" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EQvYJw9rVMY" title="Health-Movement" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
			<p>SIVANANDA YOGA : Not represented at Yogafactory but one of the essential styles of yoga is Sivananda Yoga. Swami Sivananda taught this non-proprietary form of hatha yoga in which the training focuses on preserving the health and wellness of the practitioner. Sivananda Yoga teachers are all graduates of the Sivananda Yoga Teacher Training Course, and students widely range in age and degrees of ability. Unlike Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, Sivananda yoga revolves around frequent relaxation, and emphasizes full, yogic breathing.</p>
